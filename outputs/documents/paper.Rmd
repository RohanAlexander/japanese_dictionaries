# Introduction

A crucial aspect of the data science workflow is gathering data...

The Portable Document Format (PDF) is widely used for documents that ... 

However, this advantage means that the data in PDFs cannot be used for quantitiative statistical analysis... 

Sometimes you can just copy paste.... 

But other times it's an image....

Hence, optical character recognition (OCR)...

In this paper we review various OCR options for researchers who need to gather data from PDFs that must be OCR....

When they consider a primer on what OCR options exist these days depending on your technical ability and then how they perform for an easy example and then how they perform for a hard example (the Japanese extract) and finally some suggestions for what is needed in the future....


Our paper represents...

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows...

## Test samples

Japanese dictionaries...




# Evaluation


For each option, we rank them based on two scales: results and difficulty. We need to work out a definition for each of these. 

Diego's comment: From what I learned so far, it could be easiness (an API is more straightforward than a library), number of characters correctly recognized, flexibility (the opposite of easiness), and cost. Moreover, some APIs such as Google's groups more than one character, whereas Azure returns only one character per boundary.


The main aspect of the end product will be a graph with two axis, and dots for where each service is positioned, coloured or faceted by the test.
